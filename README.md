# Statistical_Analysis_RNA
Second Project for Statistical Data Analysis 
The assignmnet was to analyse and data and use elastic net (with explanation) and random forest for prediction. The last part was an atttempt to make a new model for prediction.  
Data were derived from multimodal single cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq). For each cell we have quantity of transcripts and surface proteins (here only CD36).
Goal: Predict the quantity of CD36 protein using quantified genes expression.
